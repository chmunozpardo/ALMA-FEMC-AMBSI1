Minimon Installation Instructions

01 - extract the 'minimon.zip' file in a temporary directory (in this instructions 'temp')

02 - unzip 'minimon2.2.3.zip' (in this instructions it is assumed that it is extracted in 'temp' as well rather than another subdirectory)

03 - run the 'setup.exe' file created during the extraction

04 - choose 'OK'

05 - choose the installation directory (if you choose a non existing directory, you'll be asked - in German - if you want to create it)

06 - then click the icon displaying a terminal and 5.25" floppies

07 - you'll be asked about the name of the program group to create. After you're done, 'Weiter' will move to the next step

08 - Installation should proceed at this point

09 - you might be asked if you want to replace existing COM and DLL files. In doubt, answer 'Ja'.

12 - Copy the following files from the subdirectory 'temp\Extra_Scripts' to the subdirectory 'SCRIPTS' in the destination directory:
     test_flash.scm
     test_ram.scm

13 - Copy the entire subdirectory 'A29F010_AMBSI' from the 'temp' directory to the 'Driver' subdirectory in the destination directory.

14 - Start minimon

15 - Select 'Settings...' from the 'Interface' menu

     Port:      (the RS232 port that you will be using to talk to the AMBSI1)
     Baudrate:  57600
