This is a modified version of the A29F010 FLASH driver supplied with the minimon distribution.
This will work with 16-bit bus (2x8-bit flash chip).
The syntax of the file was updated to comply with the current keil assembler A166 Ver. 4.20.
To use it, place the whole directory A29F010_AMBSI in the minimon directory tree under the Driver directory.
The flash_ambsi.ini file uses this driver.
